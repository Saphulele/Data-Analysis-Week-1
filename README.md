                                **DATA ELEMENT**
 A discrete piece of data with a specific meaning or representation of an attribute is 
 called a data element. It could be a single piece of information or a compilation of several
 that together express a particular idea or principle. Data elements are the fundamental building
 pieces used to represent entities, properties, and connections in databases and information
 systems.

A data element in a database containing employee records might be "employee name," 
"employee ID number," "department," "hire date," etc. Together, these serve as the database's
structural building blocks and each one reflects a distinct fact about an employee.

Data structures, including as fields, records, and tables, are frequently used to arrange
data pieces and offer a framework for storing and modifying data inside a system. 
They are necessary for processing, managing, and analyzing data in a variety of industries,
including business, computer science, healthcare, and more.They make up the database's 
structure.
