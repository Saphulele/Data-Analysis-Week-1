                                **DATA ELEMENT**
                                
 A discrete piece of data with a specific meaning or representation of an attribute is 
 called a data element. It could be a single piece of information or a compilation of several
 that together express a particular idea or principle. Data elements are the fundamental building
 pieces used to represent entities, properties, and connections in databases and information
 systems.

A data element in a database containing employee records might be "employee name," 
"employee ID number," "department," "hire date," etc. Together, these serve as the database's
structural building blocks and each one reflects a distinct fact about an employee.

Data structures, including as fields, records, and tables, are frequently used to arrange
data pieces and offer a framework for storing and modifying data inside a system. 
They are necessary for processing, managing, and analyzing data in a variety of industries,
including business, computer science, healthcare, and more.They make up the database's 
structure.

                                      **TUBULAR DATA**
                                      
Tubular data is frequently used in relation to statistics and data analysis. 
It describes structured data that is grouped in rows and columns, much how data is usually found in database tables or spreadsheets. While each column represents a 
distinct variable or trait, each row represents a single observation or data point.
It is often used to emphasize the tabular nature of the data, indicating that it can be visualized as a tube-like structure with rows forming the length of the tube and columns forming the circumference. This structure makes it easy to manipulate and analyze the data using various statistical and computational techniques.

                                    **DATA TYPES IN DATA ANALYSIS**

Structured data types play a crucial role in data analysis, as they help organize and manipulate data efficiently. Here are some common structured data types used in data analysis:

                                    **Numeric Types:**

**Integer (int):** Whole numbers without decimal points, used for counting and indexing.
**Float (float):** Numbers with decimal points, used for continuous data such as measurements.

                                    **Text Type:**

**String (str):** Used to represent text data, such as names, descriptions, and labels.
**Boolean Type:**

**Boolean (bool):** Represents binary data with two possible states, True or False. Useful for logical operations and filtering.
                                    **Datetime Types:**

**Date:** Represents dates without any time information.
**Time:** Represents times without any date information.
**Datetime:** Represents both date and time together.
**Timedelta:** Represents the difference between two datetime objects.

                                    **Categorical Types:**

**Category:** Used to represent categorical data with a fixed number of unique values. Can help reduce memory usage and speed up operations.
Structured Types:

**Tuple:** An ordered collection of elements, which can be of different data types. Tuples are immutable.
**List:** Similar to tuples, but mutable, meaning elements can be added, removed, or changed.
**Dictionary:** A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value. Dictionaries are mutable and unordered.
                                    **Arrays:**

**Numpy Array:** A powerful data structure provided by the NumPy library for handling multi-dimensional arrays. It offers efficient mathematical operations and broadcasting capabilities.
                                    **DataFrames:**

**Pandas DataFrame:** A two-dimensional, size-mutable, and heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). It is widely used for data manipulation and analysis tasks.
Series:

**Pandas Series:** A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type. It is often used to represent a single column of a DataFrame or a single dimension of data.

                                    **NORMALISATION IN DATA ANALYSIS**


Normalization is a process used in database design to organize data efficiently and reduce redundancy. It involves breaking down a database schema into smaller, more manageable parts and applying certain rules to ensure data integrity. The primary goals of normalization are to minimize data redundancy and dependency, thereby improving data consistency and reducing the chances of anomalies during data manipulation.



**First Normal Form (1NF):**

Each table cell should contain a single, atomic value. There should be no repeating groups or arrays within a row.
Example: If you have a table for storing customer information, each attribute (such as name, address, phone number) should be stored in separate columns, and each column should contain only one value.

**Second Normal Form (2NF):**

**Building upon 1NF**, every non-prime attribute (attributes not part of the primary key) should be fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
In simpler terms, every non-key attribute should be fully dependent on the entire primary key, not just a part of it.
Example: If you have a composite primary key made up of multiple columns, each non-key attribute should be dependent on all of these columns, not just some of them.

**Third Normal Form (3NF):**

**Building upon 2NF**, no transitive dependency should exist.
Transitive dependency occurs when a non-prime attribute is functionally dependent on another non-prime attribute, rather than the primary key.
**Example: If A → B and B → C, then A should not directly or indirectly determine C. C should be moved to a separate table.**

Normalization helps maintain data integrity by reducing redundancy and inconsistencies, making it easier to insert, update, and delete data without encountering anomalies. However, it's essential to strike a balance between normalization and performance, as excessive normalization can lead to complex query operations and slower performance, especially in large databases
